              But I also took your live location ('google_updater.txt' wherever
              your files download to). Cute. Why wouldn't you want things
              delivered right to you? What are you hiding? I know you haven't
              been home for a few days.

              I'll keep both addresses.

              You also allowed me to download things. Like this

              and again. Not only your picture, your voice or your location. You
              allowed me to gather it all, send it and do more than just that.
              Remember the plugin I asked you to download? Aren't you a bit old
              to be this vain?
